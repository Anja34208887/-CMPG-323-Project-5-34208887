### Overview
I created a report in PowerBi for project 5. It allows users to share, view, and contribute to documents that analysing data imported from an Excel spreadsheet in this instance. 

### How to use the project
The user will view the report in the web app [Project 5](https://app.powerbi.com/groups/me/reports/26077ffc-867c-47e6-9fce-c22703fa1649/ReportSection3a0a5d678da9d08416b2)
